            Harvest was founded by Danny Wen and Shawn Liu in 2006, at a small office in downtown New York City. During the years leading up to launching Harvest, we ran a web design studio called Iridesco. As our business grew, we looked for tools to help us scale. We searched for a way to easily track time and invoice for our services. We wanted a well designed application that took user experience seriously. We wanted a service that innovated with technology.
            We couldn't find one...
          </p>
         <p>
            So we decided to invest our own time, energy and money into creating what we knew was a better way to run our business – and Harvest was born.
            Harvest was immediately embraced by other small businesses looking for a simpler and better way to work. Today, Harvest serves the time tracking and billing needs of thousands of customers around the world, from freelancers to small businesses to departments within Fortune 500 companies.
         </p>
         <p>
            Harvest is headquartered in New York City, at a large loft office in Soho. We’re independent and profitable, with our customers as our only investors. Each day we come together to listen to our users, solve problems and continue to improve our service.
